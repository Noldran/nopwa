# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

### Deploy to Github Pages


1. Create React Web App:

```
npx create-react-app my-app
```

2. Install GitHub Pages package as a dev-dependency

```
npm install gh-pages --save-dev
```

3. Add properties to `package.json` file.

The first property we need to add at the top level homepage second we will define this as a string and the value will be "http://{username}.github.io/{repo-name}" {username} is your GitHub username, and {repo-name} is the name of the GitHub repository you created it will look like this :

```json
"homepage": "https://noldran.github.io/pwa1"
```

Second in the existing scripts property we to need to add predeploy and deploy.

```json
"scripts": {
//...
"predeploy": "npm run build",
"deploy": "gh-pages -d build"
}
```

4. Create a Github repository and initialize it and add it as a remote in your local git repository.

Now, create a remote GitHub repository with your app name and go back initialize this

```
git init
```

add it as remote

```
git remote add origin https://github.com/Noldran/pwa1.git
```

First Push

```
git add .
git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -M main
```

5. Now deploy it to GitHub Pages.

just run the following command :

```
npm run deploy
```
